# Button Counter:

A simple web app to keep opened in the background and count how many jobs I applied to that day. (I lost my actual counter)

## Disclaimer:

I realize I could just go online and easily find one of these but I would like to build my own tools.

## Future Development:

May add some local storage options.

## Deployment:
